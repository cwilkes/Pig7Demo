NOTES FOR R

Get R for the mac:
  http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/
get both the R-2.XX.X.pkg and the TCLTK-8.X.dmg under tools

install R and then TCLTK.  
ln -s /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/R /usr/bin/R

to test out:
  R   # gets into shell
  cars <- c(1, 3, 6, 4, 9)
  plot(cars)
# to show how to make circles of different size
  x <- c( 3,5,10)
  y <- c( 6,10,30)
  plot(x,y)
  s <- c( 1,2, 10)
  symbols(x,y,circles=s)

You can hit Control-Z and then type bash commands.  Type "fg" to go back into the shell
